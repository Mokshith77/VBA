To create a Pivot Table in Excel with dynamic options (like selecting between Original Currency or Settlement Currency) and a Refresh Button, you can follow these steps:

Steps to Set Up:
Prepare your Data: Ensure that your data is structured in Excel with columns for GWP, NWP, GPP, NPP, Currency, Underwriting Year (UY), etc.

Create the Pivot Table:

Insert Pivot Table:

Highlight the data range.
Go to the Insert tab → PivotTable.
Place the Pivot Table in a new worksheet or an existing worksheet.
Pivot Table Setup:

Drag and drop fields into the Row Labels, Column Labels, and Values areas:
For example, put Underwriting Year (UY) in Rows.
Put Gross Written Premium (GWP), Net Written Premium (NWP), Gross Paid Premium (GPP), Net Paid Premium (NPP) in the Values area.
You can also place Currency in the Columns area if you want to see both Original and Settlement currencies.
Add a Drop-Down Menu for Currency:

Create a Drop-Down List:
In an empty cell, say A1, create a drop-down list for Currency Type (Original/Settlement).
Go to the Data tab → Data Validation.
In Allow, select List.
In the Source box, type: Original,Settlement.
Now you have a dropdown to select either Original or Settlement currency.
Set Up a Refresh Button:

Record a Macro for Refresh:
Go to the Developer tab (if not visible, enable it in Excel Options).
Click Record Macro.
In the dialog box, give the macro a name like "RefreshPivot" and hit OK.
Now manually refresh the Pivot Table by right-clicking the Pivot Table and selecting Refresh.
Stop the macro recording by clicking Stop Recording on the Developer tab.
Add a Button:
Go to the Developer tab → Insert → Button.
Draw the button somewhere near the pivot table.
Assign the macro you just recorded (RefreshPivot) to this button.
Label the button as "Refresh".
Update Pivot Table Based on Currency Selection:

To make the Pivot Table dynamic based on currency selection, we can use a combination of Excel formulas (like IF statements) or VBA code.
Here’s a VBA code you can use to update the Pivot Table based on the Currency selection in the drop-down:
